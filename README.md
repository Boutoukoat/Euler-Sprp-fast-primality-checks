# Euler-Sprp-fast-primality-checks
Fast primality tests for 3-bits to 128-bit numbers, which run under microseconds

With the proliferation of heterogeneous computing, and the performance race in CPUs, it starts to be complex to imagin how fast could a primality test run.   

This research will benefit to the community interested in topics like prime sieving, which can be implemented efficiently in both GPUs and CPUs.
