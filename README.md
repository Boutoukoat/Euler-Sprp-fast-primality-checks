# Euler-Sprp-fast-primality-checks

Fast primality tests for 3-bits to 128-bit numbers, which run under microseconds

With the proliferation of heterogeneous computing, and the performance race in CPUs, it starts to be complex to imagin how fast a primality test could run.   

This research will benefit to the community interested in topics like prime sieving, which can be implemented efficiently in both GPUs and CPUs. 

# Development status

Still work-in-progress, there are still places where cycles can be removed.
